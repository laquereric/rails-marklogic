# Go-to-Market Strategy for MCP Doctor

## Executive Summary

MCP Doctor is an AI observability and governance platform that provides **typed, explainable, queryable AI behavior** using provenance, semantics, and data contracts — not probability. We target organizations running Model Context Protocol (MCP) and agentic systems in production who need audit, compliance, and governance beyond basic monitoring.

## Target Market

- Compliance/regulatory requirements (SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA, FINRA)
- Existing data governance or observability investments
- $10M+ ARR (or Series B+ funded startups)
- 50+ engineers or 10+ AI/ML practitioners

### Secondary Customer Profile

**Mid-market companies** with:
- Aggressive AI adoption strategies
- Security/audit pain points from AI systems
- Existing MarkLogic deployments (fast path)
- $2M-10M ARR
- 10-50 engineers

# Learning Paths

This document suggests **non-binding learning paths** through the tutorial domains. These paths exist to help users orient themselves; all tutorials remain independently usable.

Learning paths may evolve over time as new tutorials are added.

## Core Foundations

Recommended for users new to the system.

1. Fundamentals: Documents, URIs, and Collections
2. Fundamentals: Document Structure and Content Types
3. Querying: Finding Documents by Collection

Focus: understanding how data is stored, identified, and retrieved.

## Query-Centered Path

Recommended when your primary goal is retrieving and shaping data.

1. Fundamentals: Documents, URIs, and Collections
2. Querying: Collection and Structured Search
3. Querying: Optic Pipelines

Focus: query design, performance, and reuse.

## Application Integration Path (Rails)

Recommended for building applications.

1. Fundamentals: Core Concepts
2. Querying: Query Patterns
3. Rails Integration: Mapping Documents to Models

Focus: applying MarkLogic concepts inside Rails applications.

## Operations and Tooling

Recommended for operators and maintainers.

1. Fundamentals: Core Concepts
2. Operations: Admin and Monitoring Tools
3. Operations: Build and Deployment Tooling

Focus: running and observing the system in practice.

## Notes

- Paths are suggestions, not requirements
- You can jump between paths at any time
- Mastery comes from reuse, not completion

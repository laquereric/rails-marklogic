# Tutorials

## Learning Philosophy: Applied Transfer Learning (ATL)

These tutorials follow **Applied Transfer Learning (ATL)**: learn one concrete idea by doing, verify that it works, and reuse that understanding elsewhere. Tutorials emphasize practice with observable outcomes and highlight how concepts transfer beyond a single example.

## Audience and Scope

These tutorials are for **users** learning to work effectively with this system.

They are **not**:
- API or command reference
- Exhaustive explanations
- Design proposals or RFCs

## Organization

Tutorials are organized by **Domains of Knowledge** and **Units of Knowledge**.

- **Domains of Knowledge** are broad conceptual areas used for navigation and orientation.
- **Units of Knowledge** are self-contained tutorials, each teaching one primary idea.

Ordering within a domain is **conceptually suggested**, never required.

## What Makes a Tutorial

A good tutorial typically:
- States a clear goal
- Explains steps with rationale
- Produces an observable result
- Indicates how the idea can be reused

## How to Use This Directory

You can start anywhere. Follow suggested orders when helpful, verify results as you go, and move between domains as your needs evolve.

## Example Domains

- **Fundamentals** — Core concepts required to understand the system
- **Data Modeling** — Structuring information for storage and evolution
- **Querying** — Retrieving and shaping data
- **Rails Integration** — Using the system from Rails applications
- **Operations** — Running and observing the system in practice

## Growth Over Time

Domains and tutorials will evolve. The structure favors clarity first and allows future learning paths or tooling to emerge without enforcing rigid workflows.

## Purpose

This domain covers the core concepts required to understand and work effectively with the system. It focuses on foundational ideas that other domains build upon and intentionally avoids advanced specialization.

## What You’ll Learn

- Core concepts and terminology
- How fundamental components fit together
- Mental models used throughout the system

## How to Use These Tutorials

Tutorials in this domain are mostly independent. A suggested conceptual order is provided to ease onboarding, but you can start with any unit that matches your needs.

## Suggested Order

1. First concepts needed to orient yourself
2. How core components interact

This order reflects conceptual dependency only and is not required.

## Tutorial Units

- *To be added* — Each unit teaches one foundational idea

## Verification & Transfer

Each tutorial includes observable success criteria and highlights where these foundational ideas reappear in other domains.

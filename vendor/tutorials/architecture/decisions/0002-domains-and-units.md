# ADR 0002: Domains and Units of Knowledge

## Status
Accepted

## Context

Flat tutorial lists and curricula-style hierarchies do not scale as knowledge grows.

## Decision

Separate tutorials into:
- **Domains of Knowledge** (conceptual organization)
- **Units of Knowledge** (individual tutorials)

Domains are folders; units are directories within domains.

## Consequences

Positive:
- Clear navigation
- Modular growth

Negative:
- Requires authors to think conceptually

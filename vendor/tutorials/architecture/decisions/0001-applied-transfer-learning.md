# ADR 0001: Applied Transfer Learning

## Status
Accepted

## Context

Traditional documentation mixes tutorials, reference, and explanation, leading to poor learning outcomes and contributor confusion.

## Decision

Adopt **Applied Transfer Learning (ATL)** as the guiding philosophy for tutorials.

ATL requires:
- One primary learning objective per tutorial
- Observable verification
- Explicit transfer guidance

## Consequences

Positive:
- Tutorials remain focused and reusable
- Contributors share a common quality bar

Negative:
- Tutorials are intentionally not exhaustive

# MCP Server / Gateway Integration

## What it is
Provide an MCP server (or gateway) that connects AI agents/assistants to observability backends and production context in a standardized way.

## Why it matters
Standardized MCP connectivity reduces bespoke integrations and makes it easier to operationalize agents across environments.

## Key signals
- Server-side request logs and trace linkage
- Tool catalog + capabilities metadata
- Security/audit trails for tool usage

## Noted in this landscape
Dynatrace (dedicated MCP server + local community server), Traceloop (OpenTelemetry MCP server), Arize (Phoenix MCP server).

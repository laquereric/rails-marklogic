# Automated Root Cause (Causal AI)

## What it is
Use an AI/causal engine to correlate signals and propose likely root causes across distributed agent workflows.

## Why it matters
Agent pipelines generate many spans/events; automated RCA helps teams triage faster and reduce alert fatigue.

## Key signals
- Cross-service dependency graphs
- Change/event correlation (deploys, config changes)
- Anomaly detection across latency/error/token metrics

## Noted in this landscape
Dynatrace (Davis causal AI).

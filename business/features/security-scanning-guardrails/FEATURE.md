# Security Scanning + Guardrails

## What it is
Identify and prevent AI security issues such as data exfiltration, prompt injection, and sensitive data leakage in prompts/responses.

## Why it matters
Agentic systems can access tools and data; visibility + scanning reduces risk and supports governance requirements.

## Key signals
- PII/secret detection outcomes
- Policy/guardrail decisions
- Tool access audits (who called what, with what scope)
- Injection indicators and blocked attempts

## Noted in this landscape
Datadog (security scanning to prevent leaks and prompt injection); enterprise vendors commonly align this with governance controls.

# Cost + Token Usage Monitoring

## What it is
Track token usage and estimated cost by model, endpoint, user, feature flag, tool chain, and environment.

## Why it matters
LLM spend can spike due to prompt bloat, loops, or tool retries. Cost visibility enables budgeting and optimization.

## Key signals
- Input/output tokens per span
- Model name/version
- Cost estimation rules per provider
- Top-N cost drivers (routes, users, tools)

## Noted in this landscape
Datadog (token usage), New Relic (cost monitoring).

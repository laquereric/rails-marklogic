# Developer Experience: Prompt Management + Trace Linking

## What it is
Developer-facing tooling to manage prompts/config, and to make traces usable: separate vs linked traces, context propagation, and workflow organization.

## Why it matters
Observability is only useful if engineers can quickly navigate and reproduce behavior; DX features reduce friction during iteration.

## Key signals
- Prompt versioning and metadata
- Trace linking strategies (parent/child, cross-trace references)
- Context propagation across agent/tool boundaries

## Noted in this landscape
Langfuse (prompt management + MCP tracing/linking/context propagation).

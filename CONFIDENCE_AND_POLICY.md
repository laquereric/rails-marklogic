# Confidence and Policy

## Confidence Principles
Confidence is derived from evidence, not predicted by models.

## Per-Answer Confidence
Computed from:
- Accepted evidence
- Rejected evidence
- Conflicts
- Temporal validity

## Historical Confidence
Tracked over time per artifact and per domain.

## Determinism
Confidence calculations must be explainable and repeatable.

## Policy Discovery
Policies emerge from patterns in evidence, not declarations.

## Policy Suggestions
- Advisory only
- Never enforced automatically

## Anti-Goals
- No probabilistic confidence
- No opaque scoring
- No silent governance

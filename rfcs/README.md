# Request for Comments (RFCs)

Use this directory to propose and track significant architectural or governance changes.

## Process
1. Copy `TEMPLATE.md` to `YYYY-serial-short-title.md` (e.g., `2026-01-mcp-v2-roadmap.md`).
2. Fill in context, proposal, impact, and rollout plan.
3. Open a pull request and gather reviews from the MCP owner, security, and affected teams.
4. Once approved and merged, link the RFC in release notes and relevant documentation.

Status badges (e.g., `Proposed`, `Accepted`, `Superseded`) should be included at the top of each RFC.
